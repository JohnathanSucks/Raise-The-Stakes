# Raise-The-Stakes
Music Replacement mod for Balatro

# Requirements
Needs [Steammodded (Alpha)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-the-alpha), specifically the 1.0 version.
You will also need [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector/releases/) and since this is a runtime injector it may trip your windows defender, but I can promise it is 100% safe.

# Installation
To install this mod all you have to do is drag the mod folder into `%AppData%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods/`. After that you should be good to go and when you have the mod activated in game it will swap the music to the Raise The Stakes versions.
